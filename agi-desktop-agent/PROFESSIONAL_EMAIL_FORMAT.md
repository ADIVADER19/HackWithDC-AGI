Hi Sarah, Thanks for thinking of us! I've looked into Acme Ventures and I'm impressed by 
your focus on frontier technologies. Your firm's willingness to invest in ambitious projects 
is really cool. We're excited about the potential fit with our AI automation work. Our recent 
growth and partnerships suggest we're on the right track. I'd love to discuss how we can work 
together. I'm available next week - how about a call on Tuesday or Wednesday? We could also 
meet in person if that's easier. I've seen that you're based in the US, so I'm flexible on timing. 
Let me know what works best for you. I'm looking forward to chatting!
