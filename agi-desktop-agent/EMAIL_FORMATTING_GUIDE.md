Dear Sarah,

Thank you for reaching out and considering our firm for partnership opportunities. 
I've reviewed Acme Ventures' impressive track record, and I'm particularly impressed

initiatives. Our recent growth trajectory and key partnerships have demonstrated the

collaborating with your team.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this partnership in greater detail. 
I am available next week and can accommodate your schedule:

• Tuesday afternoon or Wednesday morning (your timezone)
• Phone call or in-person meeting (I can travel to your location)

Please let me know which option works best, and I will confirm promptly.

Thank you again for your interest. I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Best regards,
